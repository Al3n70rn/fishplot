\title{Create a fish object after doing some input validation and data munging}
\usage{
createFishObject(frac.table, parents, timepoints = NULL, col = NULL,
  clone.labels = NULL, fix.missing.clones = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{frac.table}{A numeric matrix containing tumor fraction estimates for all clones at all timepoints}

\item{parents}{An integer vector specifying parental relationships between clones}

\item{timepoints}{An numeric vector specifying the timepoints for each column of the matrix}

\item{col}{A vector of colors to use when plotting each clone}

\item{clone.labels}{A character vector of names to assign to each clone when plotting a legend}

\item{fix.missing.clones}{A boolean value, telling whether to "correct" clones that have zero values at timepoints between non-zero values. (the clone must still have been present if it came back). Default FALSE.}
}
\value{
A fish object with the relevant slots filled
}
